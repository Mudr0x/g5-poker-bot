# Please provide as much information about your agent as possible as the
# competition organizers are very interested in knowing more about the
# techniques used by our competitors.
###########################################################################

1) Is your agent dynamic?  That is, does its strategy change throughout the
course of a match, or is the strategy played the same throughout the match?

It's dynamic.

2) Does your agent use a (approximate) Nash equilibrium strategy?

No.

3) Does your agent attempt to model your opponents?  If so, does it do so
online during the competition or offline from data (e.g., using logs of play or
the benchmark server)?

Yes. On-line.

4) Does your agent use techniques that would benefit from additional CPU time
during the competition?

Yes.

5) Does your agent use techniques that would benefit from additional RAM during
the competition?

No.

6) Would you agent benefit from additional disk space?

No.

One/Two Paragraph Summary of Technique

It traverses the game tree and tries to compute expected value of each possible action. It chooses the 
action with highest expected value. Opponent strategy (action probability distributions at villain's nodes)
is modelled using Bayesian graphical modeling. Prior probabilities for the model are obtained from on-line 
hand histories.
